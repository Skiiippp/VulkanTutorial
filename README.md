# VulkanTutorial
In a few years, Cal Poly is going to change its introductory computer graphics course to be centered around the Vulkan API, instead of OpenGL. Dr. 
Christian Eckhardt is one of the professors who teaches this class, as well as the head of the Cal Poly Mixed Reality Laboratory. As part of my work
at the CPMRL, Dr. Eckhardt has tasked me with teaching myself Vulkan using the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/), such that he can
get an understanding of the undertaking of learning Vulkan for students who do not have explicit computer graphics knowledge.
